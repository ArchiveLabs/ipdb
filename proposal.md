## Abstract

On June 30, 2015, Google discontinued Freebase[a], a large
collaborative, community run knowledge base with over 3B facts and 58M
topics[b] which it had acquired from Metaweb in 2010[a]. On October
30, 2012, Wikimedia launched the Wikidata project, "a free, linked
database [of structured entities] that can be read and edited by both
humans and machines". As of 2016-02-25, Wikidata hit 16.5M
entites[d]. The success, scale, and permanance of Wikidata is limited
by Wikimedia's resources and its community. This memorandum proposes a
defensible, decentralized knowledge base called the World Wide Graph
(`https://graph.global`) which is resiliant to single points of
failure and discontinuation (Freebase, Wikidata) and scales gracefully
without depending on a central infrastructure for resources. In this
whitepaper we propose a distributed, decentralized Wikidata
architecture built on ipfs (https://ipfs.io) and ipdb
(https://www.bigchaindb.com). We outline potential challenges and
detail the implementation details of 3 services: ipfs
(https://ipfs.archivelab.org), ipdb (https://ipdb.archivelab.org), and
graph.global (https://graph.archivelab.org) whose nodes will be run on
the Archive Labs infrastructure.

## Goal

The objective of this initiative is to jumpstart the distributed web
movement, to seed and stress-test decentralization web technologies
such as IPFS and IPDB, and to unite Wikipedia, Internet Archive, and
other reputable, mission-aligned partners, both in establishing
credibility of the distributed web movement and in securing the future
of high-value civic services like Wikidata.

## Architecture

The Archive Lab has a running ipfs node running at
https://ipfs.archivelab.org. And example of an Wikidata-like interface
for the decentralized World Wide Graph has already been prototyped at
https://graph.global.

## Roadmap

In this section, we outline the phases of development and their
respective outcomes:
